In partnership with the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi, we encourage randomly selected registered jobseekers to fill-in and publish their profile on the PES platform making them more visible to recruiters. We are able to track the effects of the intervention on a variety of outcomes, including employment, through rich administrative data and web logs provided by the French Employment Service\n\n\nWork In Progress\n\n\n\nSignaling in Recruitment: Impact on Applications and Recruiters Work Conditions\n\n\nAlexandre Aubourg, Morgane Hoffmann, Mathieu Teachout\n\n\n\nWe evaluate the effect of an innovative intervention implemented by the French Public Employment Service (PES) that consists of increasing the amount of information given by recruiters. As part of this initiative, firms are randomly asked to provide an “inversed CV” which include detailed information on work conditions, values, and direct contact details. Our analysis primarily focuses on assessing the impact of this intervention on both the quantity and quality of job hirings. Furthermore, we aim to uncover the influence of this approach on the work conditions proposed by the participating firms compared to the ones in the control group.\n\n\nWork In Progress"

Our research investigates the issue of algorithmic fairness with a specific focus on gender in a hybrid job recommendation system developed in partnership with the French Public Employment Service (PES), which is trained on past hires. First, by viewing job ads as a set of characteristics (such as wage and contract type), we document how the algorithm treats job seekers differently based on gender, both unconditionally and conditionally on their search parameters and qualifications. Second, we discuss the notion(s) of algorithmic fairness applicable in this context and the trade-offs involved. We show that the considered system reflects some existing differences in hiring or applications but does not exacerbate them. Finally, we consider adversarial de-biasing technique as a practical tool to demonstrate the trade-offs between recall and reduced differentiated treatment.\n\n\nProceedings"
