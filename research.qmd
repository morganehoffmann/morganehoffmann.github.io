        <p class="paper-abstract"> Digital matching platforms promise to reduce frictions on the labor market by providing low-cost information on available positions and candidates. As such, they may form a welcome addition to the toolbox available to Public Employment Services to bridge labor supply and demand. However, there are certain challenges associated with their adoption. For instance, vulnerable populations may face difficulties in utilizing digital tools effectively. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a communication campaign by email designed to encourage the use of an online matching platform maintained by the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi. We designed several email templates that combined information, support or motivational content to encourage jobseekers to engage with their profiles on the platform. In order to discover email effectiveness we implement an adaptive experiment (contextual bandit) where the goal is to use past jobseekers take-up responses and characteristics to determine email allocation in the future, reducing gradually the allocation of less promising templates. Additionally, we built an optimal personalization allocation strategy based on collected data and test its effectiveness. Emails had a positive impact on the usage of the platform, as measured by a wide range of outcomes. However, attempts at learning a personalized emailing strategy did not manage to significantly improve on a random allocation of email templates. </p>

        <p class="paper-abstract">In this paper, we propose to investigate the benefits of the use of digital matching platform. In partnership with the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi, we encourage randomly selected registered jobseekers to fill-in and publish their profile on the PES platform making them more visible to recruiters. We are able to track the effects of the intervention on a variety of outcomes, including employment, through rich administrative data and web logs provided by the French Employment Service </p>

        <!-- <p class="publication-date">Published: June 1, 2023</p> -->
        <p class="paper-abstract"> We evaluate the effect of an innovative intervention implemented by the French Public Employment Service (PES) that consists of increasing the amount of information given by recruiters. As part of this initiative, firms are randomly asked to provide an "inversed CV"  which include detailed information on work conditions, values, and direct contact details. Our analysis primarily focuses on assessing the impact of this intervention on both the quantity and quality of job hirings. Furthermore, we aim to uncover the influence of this approach on the work conditions proposed by the participating firms compared to the ones in the control group.</p>

        <p class="paper-abstract">Algorithmic recommendations of job ads have the potential to reduce frictional unemployment, but raise
concerns about fairness due to biases in past data. Our research investigates the issue of algorithmic
fairness with a specific focus on gender in a hybrid job recommendation system developed in partnership
with the French Public Employment Service (PES), which is trained on past hires. First, by viewing job
ads as a set of characteristics (such as wage and contract type), we document how the algorithm treats job
seekers differently based on gender, both unconditionally and conditionally on their search parameters
and qualifications. Second, we discuss the notion(s) of algorithmic fairness applicable in this context and
the trade-offs involved. We show that the considered system reflects some existing differences in hiring
or applications but does not exacerbate them. Finally, we consider adversarial de-biasing technique as a
practical tool to demonstrate the trade-offs between recall and reduced differentiated treatment. </p>
